## 📋 Organizing GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues are a great way to track your learning progress, but understanding how they work helps you stay organized.

### Understanding Issue Numbers

Issue numbers in GitHub are **sequential and permanent**. Once an issue is created with a number (e.g., #1, #2, #3), that number cannot be changed. If you create issues out of order (like creating Day 3 before Day 1), the numbers won't match the logical order.

### How to Organize Your Issues

While you can't change issue numbers, here are effective ways to organize them:

#### 1. Use Labels
Create labels like `day-1`, `day-2`, `day-3` to categorize your learning issues:
- Go to your repository → **Issues** tab → **Labels** → **New label**
- Color-code them for easy identification
- Filter issues by label to see them in logical order

#### 2. Use Milestones
Group related issues into milestones:
- Create milestones like "Week 1 Learning" or "JavaScript Basics"
- Assign issues to milestones for better organization
- Track completion percentage

#### 3. Use GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects provides a Kanban-style board:
- Create columns like "To Do", "In Progress", "Completed"
- Drag and drop issues to reorder them visually
- Add custom fields for sorting

#### 4. Issue Titles
Use clear, sequential titles:
- `Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript`
- `Day 2: Variables and Data Types`
- This makes sorting by title effective

### Best Practice: Plan Before Creating

To keep issues in order:
1. Plan your learning topics first
2. Create all issues in the correct sequence
3. Use descriptive titles with day/topic numbers

### Sorting Issues

On the Issues page, you can sort by:
- **Newest** / **Oldest** - by creation date
- **Most commented** / **Least commented**
- **Recently updated**

Use the search bar with filters:
- `is:issue is:open sort:created-asc` - Shows open issues sorted by creation date (oldest first)
- `is:issue label:day-1` - Shows all issues with the day-1 label
